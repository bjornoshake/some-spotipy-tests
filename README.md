# Spotipy Tests 

This repository will be used as a platform to do tests using the Spotify Web API, via the lightweight python package "spotipy" -> https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/master/


The final project would be : 
Entering a song / artist name -> getting the spotify id -> getting all the spotify API metrics + the lyrics (Using lyricsgenius).
